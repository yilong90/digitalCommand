Release Notes for the 5.4 SMA Decoder Examples
1. Buf fix to allow maximum of 17 servos

2. Bug Fix to correct 2 reload #define definitions

3. Change to major Loop Delay cut in half to allow for fewer misses of DCC packet detection

4. File Decoders_MultiFunction_Description.rtf has minor edits for new file names and 6FTN version.

Release Notes for the 5.1 SMA Decoder Examples

1. Automatic servo attachment and detachment has been implemented for all
   servo control functions. When a servo has stopped at the end of its traverse, 
   it will be "detached" by the software. This has been demonstrated 
   to reduce power consumption greatly and reduce servo "chatter."

2. Several bug fixes including all reported bugs as of May 2016

3. In the fully conficurable verions. all 17 pins now can be configured for any of 6 functions
   Config 0=On/Off,1=Blink,2=Servo,3=DBL LED Blink,4=variable Pulse ,5=fade on

4. Servo timing has a timing modifier added for extra slow servo traverse
   #define servo_slowdown  3   //servo loop counter limit
   Can be set from 0 to 255  -- the higher the number the slower the traverse

5. Software has been restructured to support new NmraDcc library releases 
   including the NmraDcc-MicroBahner library version.
